# transproblem-rs
Rust application for solving Linear Programming problem of finding optimal solution for transportation problem.

The most of phrases written in Russian for several reasons:
 * this project for my classmates
 * at the moment there is no good tool to integrate translation for the Rust
 * I'm bad in english

Feel free to write me a mail or create a issue, if you need a translation.
